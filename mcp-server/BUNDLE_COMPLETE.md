# MCP Server Bundle Complete ðŸŽ‰

## Summary

The MCP server is now a fully self-contained npm package! All skills have been bundled directly into the package, eliminating the need to run from source.

## What Changed

### 1. **Bundled All Skills**

- Copied all 26 verified skills from `minecraft-client/src/bot/skills/verified/` to `mcp-server/src/skills/verified/`
- Copied all library skills from `minecraft-client/src/bot/skills/library/` to `mcp-server/src/skills/library/`
- Copied type definitions and helper functions

### 2. **Fixed Import Paths**

- Updated all skill imports from `../../../types/skillType` to `../../types/skillType`
- Updated helper imports from `..` to `../index`

### 3. **Updated Skill Registry**

- Modified `skillRegistry.ts` to load skills from the bundled location (`dist/skills/verified/`)
- No longer depends on external compiled files

### 4. **Package Configuration**

- Updated `package.json` to include source files in the npm package
- Version bumped to `0.2.0` to reflect this major improvement
- Added `src/`, `tsconfig.json` to the files array

### 5. **Documentation**

- Updated README.md to reflect that the package can now be installed via npm
- Removed the note about needing to run from source

## How to Publish

Run the publish script:

```bash
cd mcp-server
./publish.sh
```

This will:

1. Build the TypeScript code (compiling all bundled skills)
2. Publish to npm

## Usage After Publishing

Users can now simply:

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g @fundamentallabs/minecraft-mcp

# Run the MCP server
minecraft-mcp -p 25565 -h localhost
```

No more cloning repos or building from source! ðŸš€

## Technical Details

The bundled structure:

```
mcp-server/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ skills/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ verified/     # 26 skill implementations
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ library/      # Helper functions
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.ts      # Helper exports
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ types/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ skillType.ts  # Skill interfaces
â”œâ”€â”€ dist/                 # Compiled JavaScript
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ skills/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ verified/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ library/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.js
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ types/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ skillType.js
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

When published, npm includes both source and compiled files, allowing the package to work standalone.
