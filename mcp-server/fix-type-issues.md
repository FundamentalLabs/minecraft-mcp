# Remaining Type Issues in Bundled Skills

## Summary

After bundling skills into the MCP server, several type safety issues remain. These are mostly due to differences in how the original code handled nullable/optional types vs TypeScript's strict type checking.

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. Optional AbortSignal

**Issue**: Skills receive `signal?: AbortSignal` but pass it to functions expecting `signal: AbortSignal`

**Pattern**:

```typescript
// Problem
signal: serviceParams.signal,  // Type 'AbortSignal | undefined'
```

**Solution**: Provide a default signal or check for undefined

```typescript
signal: serviceParams.signal ?? AbortSignal.timeout(300000), // 5 minute timeout
```

### 2. Functions Returning undefined Instead of boolean

**Issue**: Functions typed to return `Promise<boolean>` have paths that return undefined

**Pattern**:

```typescript
if (condition) {
    return;  // Type 'undefined' is not assignable to type 'boolean'
}
```

**Solution**: Return explicit boolean

```typescript
if (condition) {
    return false;
}
```

### 3. Possibly Null Values

**Issue**: Values that could be null are used without null checks

**Pattern**:

```typescript
block.position.x  // Object is possibly 'null'
```

**Solution**: Add null checks

```typescript
if (block) {
    block.position.x
}
```

### 4. Type Assertions for Known Values

Some cases where we know a value exists but TypeScript doesn't:

- Use non-null assertion operator `!` when certain
- Add runtime checks when uncertain

## Skills Affected

Most skills have at least one of these issues:

- attackSomeone, cookItem, dropItem, giveItemToSomeone - AbortSignal issue
- craftItems, goToKnownLocation, harvestMatureCrops - Return type issues  
- Many skills - Possibly null block/entity references

## Recommended Approach

1. For MCP server usage, we can provide default values for optional parameters
2. Add runtime null checks where needed for safety
3. Use type assertions sparingly where we have domain knowledge

## Note

These issues don't prevent the skills from working at runtime - they're TypeScript strict mode issues. The original code worked with these patterns, but TypeScript's strict null checks and type safety catch potential issues.
